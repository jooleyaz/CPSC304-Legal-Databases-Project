## Project Description
We are modeling a legal system, specifically court cases and their associated information. 
For example, in a murder case, you could store the lawyers' information as well as their represented victim and perpetratorâ€™s information, evidence belonging to each case, who the judges, jury, and witnesses are, as well as the state of the case and when and where the hearings were held.
